CORS error  
way-1
to resolve CORS error we can create proxy in vite.config.js file
which will append http://localhost:3000 in request url when get method is called for 
/api/jokes route and it will also tell the server that request is coming from same origin/server
so no issue of Cross Origin Resource Sharing

way-2
we can directly use cors npm package
